> Reference: [Introduction to Management and Ethics](../../lectures/introduction)

In the kickoff lecture for this course, the lecturer introduced and defined the term "ethics" as the idealogy of "What I should do", rather than "What to do". Ethics is the consideration of the rules, principles, duties, rights, obligations, and consequences of a particular action (or inaction).
