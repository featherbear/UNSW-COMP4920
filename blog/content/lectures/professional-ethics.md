# Ethics in the Profession

* Obligations - Special relationships
* Duties - Common relationships
  * Social Responsibility
* Samaritanism
  * Minimally decent - i.e. Answering someone's question for the time
  * Supererogation - above the call of duty

---

Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics" - Some things can be precise, and should be answered with precision. But some things, however, cannot be precise and should not be dealt with the same lens lens of precision.

# When you're trying to do the right thing, but it's difficult

## Partisanship

* Trying to act in the best interest of the client
* Too sympathetic (accepting) of a client's unrealistic interests, and supporting more than advising

## Rationalisation

* Considering the situation under a light that supports your own interest more than the client's
* "It's okay because everyone else does it"
* "If I don't do it, someone else will"
* "I deserve this"
* "No one will get hurt if I do it"

## Implicit / Unconscious Bias

* Substituting stereotypes over real knowledge
* Unconsciously generated overconfidence in your ability

* "They're like me"

## Ethical Blindness / Illiteracy

* Failing to see an ethical issue
* Can be permanent - needs serious re-education
* Can be temporary - narrow-scoped

## Reasoning with False Equivalency

* If it's legal, then it's moral
* If there's no law against it, it's okay to do it

## Ethical Scripting

Using a template/previous event to dictate the approach/decisions to/of an ethical scenario, when it is incompatible

i.e. Doing only a cost-benefit analysis on an issue that could involve the loss of human lives (i.e. [Ford Pinto](#ford-pinto))

# Ford Pinto

> Refer to [first seminar](../../seminars/week1/#ford-pinto)

Legal requirement: Safe for a collision at 20mph - The Pinto passed this test

* Exposed bolt near fuel tank - would rupture if a collision occurred over 25 mph
* Safety was considered an acceptable risk
* Making the change $137.5 M > Benefits $49.53 M

* Didn't consider ___reputational cost___

# Exception which proves (test) the rule

special consideration

# Counterexample

Disproving a statement by showing an example which violates it.  

> Note: We regard something as a counterexample, rather than say that it is true that something is a counterexample

# Anomaly

An example which violates a widely known rule

Moral judgement

principled judgments
justifiable
integrity

moral behaviour
principled behaviour
justifiable
avoidance of hypocrisy

"Relevantly Similar"

---

* Rules and regulation replace judgement

* Accountability - Reactive
  * Tracking, checklists, processes, directives, liability
* Responsibility - Proactive
  * Judgments and discretion

Cannot have 100% responsibility and 0% accountability, or 100% accountability and 0% responsibility. There needs to be a balance

* Code of Ethics - Responsibility  
* Code of Conduct - Accountability

Code of conduct - When there is no single 'best thing', but rather a 'best reason to do ____'
* An organisation's code of conduct can help to remove 'individual heat'

---

# Ethical Awareness

* Avoid **moral negligence** - is there a concern of moral
* Avoid **moral blindness / illiteracy** - correct scope
* Avoid **moral recklessness** - scopes adequately addressed
* Exhibit **moral competence**

---

# Ethical Caution

Preventing, avoiding, and minimising the unethical

"precautionary principle" in cases where we don't know that something is not harmful / of no risk, consider it as harmful / of risk.
