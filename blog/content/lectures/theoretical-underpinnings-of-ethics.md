_Edit: I didn't like this lecture. Too many loose ends left, too many terms that are not clearly explained, slides kept jumping around._

> Ethics is ___more than just___ "recognition that there are appropriate interests other than your own that should act as constraints on unbridled pursuit of self-interest"

# The Cost of Ethics

* When ethics is involved, there is a winner and a loser
* This can be mitigated if you can turn an ethical problem into a non-ethical problem
  * Sharing a secret by asking for permission

# Ethical Relativism 

* Ethics is not purely based on environmental factors
  * The idea of _Ethical Relativism_ (ethics differ from time, culture, etc...) is fundamentally untrue
  * Some values remain true throughout all cultures
    * Honesty
    * Integrity
    * Fairness
    * Compassion
    * Openness

# Descriptive Relativism

* "it's what goes on"
* culture-to-culture
* Descriptive Ethics - What people do and how they think  

# Normative Relativism

* All views are equally correct
* We should not interfere with or judge other culture's values

## Prescriptive Ethics

> "What people should do and behave"

<!--
* Do what makes you happy
* Behave the way you would want other people to behave
-->

* Normative Ethics (principles) - general
* Normative Issues
* Casuistry, Moralising - specific

An moral judgment must be backed by all three

---

* Your moral opinion should be non-negotiable - isn't decided by a 'vote'

Ethics is a mixture of

* Rules -- Individual Morality
* Consequences, Outcomes -- Individual Morality
* Codes, Laws -- Role Morality

# Imannuel Kant (1785)

<!-- * Book: Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals -->

* **Must be talking about something other than consequences**
* Duty
* Made the decision

* Actions come from a principle

* 'Perfect duty' - Allows no change
* 'Imperfect duty' - Allows for change

Imperative - 'do this', 'do that'

'Maxims' - General principles  
Maxims - **why** are you doing it

First formulation - <s>Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that that it should become a universal law -i.e. everyone is required to do it</s> "So act, that on the rule which though actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all rational beings"

Second formulation - Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end as never as a means only -i.e. requirement to respect people's personhood

* Duty as basic moral feature

* Duty is not an inclination or achievement of some particular result - it is the central notion of morality.
* The agent is responsible for what they do


* Good will -> Duty
  * Agent autonomy
  * Morality not a matter of luck or accident

* Avoidance of hypocrisy

# John Stuart Mill (1861)

We have an idea of what we're trying to accomplish

* **Consequences are what matters**
* Generalised: To achieve happiness
* Anti-Kant

# W.D Ross (1930)

* 'Prima facie' duties - "at first glance"
  * duties resting on one's own previous acts (ie promises, reparation)
  * duties resting on other's previous acts (ie gratitude)
  * duties resting on the possible inappropriate distribution of pleasure/happiness
  * duties resting on the possibility of being able to improve people's conditions (virtue/intelligence/pleasure)
  * duties resting on the possibility of being able to improve our own conditions (virtue/intelligence)
  * duties resting on the recognition that there is a distinction between helping and not harming

* Moral pluralism - There is no one single moral theory or principle that should be acceptable as preferable to others

* Moral Pluralism != Moral Relativism

---

# Thomas Hobbes (1651)

* Without society, there is no ethics 
* Ethics is contractual
  * Requires a contract between the parties concerned

* Equality - everyone has equal rights
* Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged such that
  * Any benefits must benefit the least advantaged class
  * Fair equality of opportunity

---

# Procedural Justice

A procedure for doing something can be just (or not just), depending on

* Perfect procedural justice - You know a just outcome, and a procedure to always achieve it
* Imperfect procedural justice - You know a just outcome, and you try to achieve it
* Pure procedural justice - A just outcome is irrelevant of the procedure

---

# Plato

Plato states that virtues are the things that enable something to function well.

i.e. a sharp edge is the virtue of a knife

# Aristotle

* Moral virtues - concerned with 'doing things'
* Intellectual virtues - concerned with 'thinking'

* Courage is the virtue concerned with the appropriate feelings of fear and confidence. It is the mean between feeling too little fear and feeling too much fear
