<!-- You're given two options: kill people or make profit. Mill says you are inherently a bad person. Kant says you're a good person as long as you don't think about the choice. -->

<!-- A TL;DR, as donated by a friend

---

- Randy programmed a module which caused an error that killed Bart Matthews, a robot operator
- Randy didn't have sufficient robotic background to understand the robotic physics
- Randy's team lead, Sam Reynolds vehemently opposed prototyping methodology which would allow early feedback of the robotic operator to the system in favour of the waterfall methodology which Reynolds had used extensively in his data processing team lead experience
- Test was forfeited by a software testing engineer grad, Cindy Yarely, in the order of the robotic division head, Ray Johnson, to speed up development in the argument of "Ivory Snow" theory which states a software doesn't have to be perfect to deploy
- Robotic division head Ray Johnson was under tremendous pressure to deliver the robots before a deadline from his boss, Siltech CEO Michael Watterson.
- Randy was prosecuted by prosecutor general of Silicon Valley, Jane McMurdock by manslaughter who had connection to Watterson from Watterson's generous political contribution
- Theories of causes had been formulated:
    - Martha (insider informant of Siltech) told news paper that there was strong tension between Johnson and Reynolds
    - Randy's a prima donna who cannot take in criticisms (a professor in programmer psychology hypothesized that this might be due to incompetencies in the robotic domain). (had to stole code to make programs work)
    - Justice for programmer group argued that
        - McMurdock's prosecution is a way to get Siltech out of responsibility because of Watterson's political funding
        - Siltech didn't provide sufficient training to users of the robots
    - Jan Anderson, a programmer who left the robotic project of the killer robot, strongly suggested that using Waterfall model was the cause because it couldn't incorporate operators' inputs
    - Professor Silbert led a team which found the software tests were forfeited under the instructions of Johnson, who in a memo believed that the robot would be safe nevertheless because of the user interface
    - A professor in interface examined the interface of the software and believed that the interface wasn't up to par with interface principles at all and the difficulty in using was the killer
- Professor Yoder's conclusions on ethics:
    - Principles on ethics (5 tests, such as can you tell your mom and can you tell in a national tv broadcast)
    - Cindy Yarley not ethical because won't be able to tell  in a national tv broadcast
    - Samuel not ethical because of stealing code and incompetencies
    - Ray Johnson not ethical because the ivory snow theory can only work if the customers are also aware of the flaws.
    - Watterson not ethical because of placing Reynolds in charge mainly to save money
    - the environment as well as the individuals' actions formed a vicious cycle for the downard ethics

Jane McMurdock → (accuses) Randy Samuels

Randy programmed→ robot killed → Bart Matthews 

Sentinel Observer → asks Professors Bill Park for opinions

Martha (insider) said friction between Robot project manager Sam Reynolds and Robotics Division chief Ray Johnson 

Ivory Snow a theory by robotic division chief ray johnson, softwares only needs to work

Randy Samuels (prima donna→ can not take criticisms?)

Jan Anderson → methodology is flawed (should use prototyping instead of waterfall since high complexity of robot interaction?)

Michael Waterson -> appoints Sam Reynolds to head of project opposed by Ray Johnsom

Sam Reynolds (manager of project) -> supporter of waterfall model

Justice for programmer association -> not Randy's fault

1. political contribution from Michael Waterson to Jane McMurdock (prosecutor general) to cover company's responsibility up
2. company didn't provide training for safety measures, which Randy implemented

another view:

robots' interface problem → no feedback and generally v hard to use

Professor Silbert: asked by the CEO of robotic company to conduct a quality assurance audit

→ some testing results were forfeited. Sam Reynoldes (project supervisor hired attorney to defend). Johnson (robotic division head) ivory snow (almost perfect to ship)

Cindy Yarley-> produced fake testing per request from Johnson

Randy Samuels stole code from a commercial library

Professor Yoder (ethics professor):

Cindy Yarey -> not ethical because not passing 5 tests (can't tell mom and national tv)

Samuel -> not ethical (stealing and incompetent)

Ray Johnson -> ivory snow unethical because customers not aware of the bugs, robots is safe

Watterson -> placed Sam  Reynolds who doesn't know robots in charge, pressure, eavesdropping, Randy not guilty because only incompetence

Overall: environment and individual vicious cycle

## The Death

* _Bart Matthews_ was killed by an assembly line robot
* Robot malfunctions and waved its 'arm' violently
* The arm struck Bart, "throwing him against a wall and crushing his skull"
* Bart was the first operator of the new robot

## The Charges

* _Jane McMurdock_ (attack attorney) said that _Randy_ (prosecutee) was negligent in correctly interpreting the [physics] formula
* _Bill Park_ verified the formulas were right, but the code implementation was wrong

## The Meta / Environment

* The company had a time pressure to finish the project
  * They were 6 months behind schedule
* There was friction between _Sam Reynolds_ (Project Head) and _Ray Johnson_ (Robotics Chief) of the company
* Robotics Division might be terminated if the project failed
* Twenty programmers were added
  * "the new hirees were not fully integrated into the project, even six months later, when ten Robbie CX30 robots, including the robot which killed Bart Matthews, were shipped out"

## The Team

* _Randy_ (prosecutee) was labelled as a 'prima donna' - someone who could not accept criticism
  * He once stormed out of a code review meeting
* The entire team was involved in the entire SDL
* _Sam Reynolds_ had background in data processing, not hardware - the project lead should have been given to _Ray Johnson_, who had a background in robotics
* The president of the company moved _Reynolds_ to the Robotics Division rather than to hire a new project leader - cost effectiveness

## The Development

* Waterfall vs Prototyping approach
  * Prototyping approach was much better suited, but the the project head (_Sam Reynolds_) opted for the Waterfall Model
  * _Jan Anderson_ (ex-programmer) was fired for disagreeing
    * "Since operator interaction with the robot is so important, the interface cannot be designed as an afterthought"
* The code was stated to be tolerant to 'exceptional conditions'
  * (Obviously it was not)


## Dodgy Deals - Politics and Collusion

* The company stated that they would deliver robots which would "cause no bodily injury to the human operator"
* The prosecution was directed to _Randy (prosecutee)_ rather than the company
* The CEO had financially supported the attack attorney in her re-election campaign
* The requirements specification would have stated that the company should be legally responsible for any injury or death, not any [specific] employee

## Deployment - Training

* The requirements document stated that operators will be exhaustively trained in safety procedures
  * Operators will be verified (by a test)
* Staff of the client company were never trained or taught about how to handle the 'exceptional conditions'
  * Bart did try to open up the reference manual for errors

## User Interface

> Schneiderman's 'Eight Golden Rules'

1) Strive for consistency  
2) Enable frequent users to use shortcuts  
3) Offer informative feedback  
4) Design dialogues to yield closure  
5) Offer simple error handling  
6) Permit easy reversal of actions  
7) Support internal locus of control  
8) Reduce short-term memory load  

According to Horace Gritty, the user interface failed to adhere to even a single rule.

* Keyboard but no mouse
* Manuals for everything - rather that inbuilt help
  * WHY ARE THERE FOUR VOLUMES OF THE SAME MANUAL
* Poor ergonomics
  * Computer screen was a distance away from the manuals (bad proximity)
  * Chair was bad
* Menus were overcomplicated
* Menus were not ideally arranged
* Poor use of colours
* Poor use of light effects
* Poor choice of sound effects

## Testing

* Static Analysis, Dynamic Analysis
* Whitebox and Blackbox tests

* "Neither blackbox nor whitebox testing 'proves' that a program is correct"
* A test succeeds when a bug is found
* When comparing the test results with the outputs recorded in the test documents, they were found to be dissimilar
  * Tests may have been faked
  * The right code was written, but wrong version was deployed

### Communications

* _Cindy Yardley_ admitted to doctoring fake test results
* Discovered that _Ray Johnson_ (Robotics Head) instructed _Cindy_ to fake the results

## Safety

> "The user interface was designed so as to permit the operator to stop [...] any life-threatening robot motion"

> "The user interface is our line of defense"

The safety of the robot was dependent on the competency of the operator

## Code Reuse (IP)

> Weee copyright

* Code was taken from a commercial software package `PACKSTAT 1-2-3`

# Comments

* Time pressure
* Job stability pressure
* Adding more staff during the late stages
* Wrong staff for the wrong job
* Cost-saving
* Workplace friction - ("wasting time" - Reynolds)
* SDL - Waterfall vs Prototyping
* Responsibility
* Political collusion
* Lack of training and verification
* User interface - overcomplicated, unfamiliar, user not in control
* Testing
* Safety limitations not in place

# Aside: Interesting quotes

* "The idea of egoless programming is that a software product belongs to the team and not to the individual programmers. The idea is to be open to criticism and to be less attached to one's work. Code reviews are certainly consistent with this overall philosophy"

* A test succeeds when a bug is found

* "Burdens of responsiblity not guilt"
