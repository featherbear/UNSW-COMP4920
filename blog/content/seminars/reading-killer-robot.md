<!-- You're given two options: kill people or make profit. Mill says you are inherently a bad person. Kant says you're a good person as long as you don't think about the choice. -->

A TL;DR, as donated by a friend

- Randy programmed a module which caused an error that killed Bart Matthews, a robot operator
- Randy didn't have sufficient robotic background to understand the robotic physics
- Randy's team lead, Sam Reynolds vehemently opposed prototyping methodology which would allow early feedback of the robotic operator to the system in favour of the waterfall methodology which Reynolds had used extensively in his data processing team lead experience
- Test was forfeited by a software testing engineer grad, Cindy Yarely, in the order of the robotic division head, Ray Johnson, to speed up development in the argument of "Ivory Snow" theory which states a software doesn't have to be perfect to deploy
- Robotic division head Ray Johnson was under tremendous pressure to deliver the robots before a deadline from his boss, Siltech CEO Michael Watterson.
- Randy was prosecuted by prosecutor general of Silicon Valley, Jane McMurdock by manslaughter who had connection to Watterson from Watterson's generous political contribution
- Theories of causes had been formulated:
    - Martha (insider informant of Siltech) told news paper that there was strong tension between Johnson and Reynolds
    - Randy's a prima donna who cannot take in criticisms (a professor in programmer psychology hypothesized that this might be due to incompetencies in the robotic domain). (had to stole code to make programs work)
    - Justice for programmer group argued that
        - McMurdock's prosecution is a way to get Siltech out of responsibility because of Watterson's political funding
        - Siltech didn't provide sufficient training to users of the robots
    - Jan Anderson, a programmer who left the robotic project of the killer robot, strongly suggested that using Waterfall model was the cause because it couldn't incorporate operators' inputs
    - Professor Silbert led a team which found the software tests were forfeited under the instructions of Johnson, who in a memo believed that the robot would be safe nevertheless because of the user interface
    - A professor in interface examined the interface of the software and believed that the interface wasn't up to par with interface principles at all and the difficulty in using was the killer
- Professor Yoder's conclusions on ethics:
    - Principles on ethics (5 tests, such as can you tell your mom and can you tell in a national tv broadcast)
    - Cindy Yarley not ethical because won't be able to tell  in a national tv broadcast
    - Samuel not ethical because of stealing code and incompetencies
    - Ray Johnson not ethical because the ivory snow theory can only work if the customers are also aware of the flaws.
    - Watterson not ethical because of placing Reynolds in charge mainly to save money
    - the environment as well as the individuals' actions formed a vicious cycle for the downard ethics

Jane McMurdock → (accuses) Randy Samuels

Randy programmed→ robot killed → Bart Matthews 

Sentinel Observer → asks Professors Bill Park for opinions

Martha (insider) said friction between Robot project manager Sam Reynolds and Robotics Division chief Ray Johnson 

Ivory Snow a theory by robotic division chief ray johnson, softwares only needs to work

Randy Samuels (prima donna→ can not take criticisms?)

Jan Anderson → methodology is flawed (should use prototyping instead of waterfall since high complexity of robot interaction?)

Michael Waterson -> appoints Sam Reynolds to head of project opposed by Ray Johnsom

Sam Reynolds (manager of project) -> supporter of waterfall model

Justice for programmer association -> not Randy's fault

1. political contribution from Michael Waterson to Jane McMurdock (prosecutor general) to cover company's responsibility up
2. company didn't provide training for safety measures, which Randy implemented

another view:

robots' interface problem → no feedback and generally v hard to use

Professor Silbert: asked by the CEO of robotic company to conduct a quality assurance audit

→ some testing results were forfeited. Sam Reynoldes (project supervisor hired attorney to defend). Johnson (robotic division head) ivory snow (almost perfect to ship)

Cindy Yarley-> produced fake testing per request from Johnson

Randy Samuels stole code from a commercial library

Professor Yoder (ethics professor):

Cindy Yarey -> not ethical because not passing 5 tests (can't tell mom and national tv)

Samuel -> not ethical (stealing and incompetent)

Ray Johnson -> ivory snow unethical because customers not aware of the bugs, robots is safe

Watterson -> placed Sam  Reynolds who doesn't know robots in charge, pressure, eavesdropping, Randy not guilty because only incompetence

Overall: environment and individual vicious cycle
