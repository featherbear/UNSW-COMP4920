Note: This report presents a statement by fictitious ethical investment company `XYZ Holdings`  
Issue: The Cost of Achieving Environmental Sustainability of IT

# Investment Assessment of Samsung Electronics

<!-- Brief background on the issue being discussed, to provide sufficient context, history and evidence. -->

## Background

Samsung Group is a massive conglomerate that is involved in many business sectors, from urban development to fashion & apparel, to life & health insurance, and even financial trading. They are noticeably known for their technology and electronics subsidiary, Samsung Electronics. Originally based in South Korea, they have since expanded their offices and facilities to 74 different countries. Consequently, Samsung has become a large consumer - and producer - of materials and waste.

Crucial to `XYZ Holdings` is our promise towards ethical commitment in both our company and our investment partners.  
This report investigates Samsung Electronics' ethical decisions involved in their information technology products.

<!-- In depth ethical discussion. You need to clearly identify the ethical issue, and analyse it using ethical reasoning. Identify stakeholders, present the perspectives from both sides of the issue, and analyse the issue in terms of ethical theories (duty and consequence-based), and only if relevant, one code of conduct/ethics (e.g. the ACS Code of Conduct for an Australian IT company). -->

## Ethical Issue: The Cost of Achieving Environmental Sustainability of IT

Companies in the technology and electronics sector would have to face several important business decisions contending to the environmental sustainability of its products. Environmental sustainability (of an electronic good) can be defined as the consideration of a product's effect on the Earth during its entire manufacture and usage lifecycle, as to prolong the longevity of Earth's resources and environment. These decisions (both software and hardware) all pertain to the issue of whether or not a company should spend time and resources towards product sustainability guidelines and protocols if it will incur a non-trivial cost.

The stakeholders involved in the outcomes of these decisions are the company itself and its customers.

**From a utilitarian/consequential perspective** it would be unwise to implement environmental sustainability guidelines and protocols, as it will drive up manufacturing and development costs. A commitment towards environmental sustainability is not a whimsical decision, and would be costly to both the company and its customers. During the developmental stage, extra time and resources will be required for engineers to develop and energy-efficient technologies, as well as other measures that allow for a long product lifetime (i.e software compatibility and updates). During the manufacturing stage, costs will arise from the sourcing and selection of sustainable resources that are often dearer in price, as well as costs resulting from opting for more environmentally friendly manufacturing methods. In addition, the responsible management of manufacturing waste - such as the safe disposal of SVHC (_Substances of Very High Concern_) products will furthermore increase the manufacturing cost.

If these environmental sustainability guidelines were to be implemented, with the products being sold at the same price - a company would lose profit per unit sold. However if they increase the price, customers may opt out of buying the product as it is unaffordable. As a result, the company will in fact lose revenue to that customer who might purchase a similar technology product from another company. Conversely, if the decision _against_ environmental sustainability is made, the costs of the final product would be minimised, allowing a larger number of customers to purchase the product, hence increasing sales and profits to the company and overall customer satisfaction. Hence it can be seen as ethical to not implement sustainability guidelines, so that more people will be able to afford the products.

However in light of **Kantian/duty ethics**, the decision not to pursue environmental sustainability is morally unethical, as it forgoes the company's responsibility as a social and global citizen (that is, an entity that involves themselves for the betterment of the world). A company's countenance towards the aforementioned utilitarian perspective can be attributed towards a result of corporate greed, where resources are consumed without consideration of any potential environmental impacts. It is to be noted that this behaviour is not solely of the onus of the company, but also of consumer greed - where customers are always demanding for the cheapest prices, regardless of any environmental ramifications that may be associated. Consequently, according to duty-based ethics, it is unethical for both the company and the customers to consider environmental sustainability as an 'option' rather than a duty.

As all companies acquire their materials from the same finite pool of resources (i.e. the world), a company who consumes a large portion of resources must hold some responsibility towards the eventual depletion of future resources. It can then be seen as ethical for a company to increase their product prices (as a result of environmentally sustainable practices) for reasons less to do with maintaining a profit margin, but rather as a statement to bring awareness of everyone's role as a global citizen.

## Samsung's Response to its Environmental Sustainability of IT

Samsung has invested heavily into working towards being an environmentally sustainable global citizen, agreeing with the view through duty-based ethics. Samsung's Sustainability Statement announces their **"[pursuit of] corporate social responsibility and social management through business activities that put Earth first"**. _(Eco-Management | Our Commitment. Samsung Australia, 2020)_[^eco-management]

[^eco-management]: Samsung Australia. Eco-Management | Our Commitment. [online] Available at: <https://www.samsung.com/au/aboutsamsung/sustainability/environment/our-commitment/> [Accessed 7 November 2020].

 This statement has not just been spoken for public relations, rather it is fundamentally ingrained into the entire lifecycle of their products, such as their mobile phones. True to the statement, Samsung has made business and design decisions to increase the lifespans of their products, as well as the individual materials of the products.

As a company, Samsung has dedicated resources into technical research and development of energy-efficient components that produce a lower carbon footprint. Samsung has also been proactive in pursuing a high recycle rate for manufacturing waste, reaching their recycling ratio of 95% earlier than they had planned for. _(Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report 2017, 2020)_[^recycle-report]

By providing free firmware upgrades, customers are able to continue using their current device whilst gaining the latest features. Furthermore, extended warranty durations and repair service offerings consequently mean that Samsung can manufacture less units, hence consuming less of the Earth's resources. Samsung also endorses the purchase and resell of refurbished products, such that an old device can be repurposed rather than appear in landfill. _(Resource Efficiency | Environment.

<!-- > A short conclusion comprising a judgement of the ethical or unethical nature of the company's activities in relation to the issue discussed.  -->

A consequential ethical perspective of the tradeoff between achieving environmental sustainability, and the costs involved suggest that it is better to not pursue environmental sustainability so that products will be affordable and within purchase reach of all customers. A duty-based ethical perspective suggests that it is of utmost importance for both the company and its customers to advocate for environmental sustainability. Samsung Electronics' pursuit of environmental sustainability is of sufficient ethical behaviour, and having demonstrated sufficient ethical awareness and responsibility in the manufacture and business of their products, `XYZ Holdings` is happy to invest in Samsung Electronics.
