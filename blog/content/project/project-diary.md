I made a little web app to show my project diary, as it would better visualise the activity of my development, grouped by development week/sprint.

You can view it [here](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-SENG4920-diary/).

It uses an old Svelte project I made last year called [Filmstrip Messages](https://github.com/featherbear/filmstrip-messages). Yay for being able to reuse code!
